  # When Travis decides to deploy your code base, it's going to take all of the files inside of your GitHub repository.

  # to an S3 bucket, which is essentially a hard drive running on AWS
  # Once it copies all those files over Traviss, then going to essentially poke at elasticbeanstalk
  # use that to redeploy your application.
